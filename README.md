We want our project to make more people interested in traditional Indonesian batik clothing. One problem is that there aren't many options for customizing batik outerwear. Our goal is to create an app that teaches people about different types of batik and lets them personalize their batik outerwear. The project team wants to bring more cultural pride and awareness into everyday life, especially by appreciating batik patterns found in clothing. Our aim is to develop a mobile app that integrates this traditional art into daily experiences. Using technology, we want to recognize and celebrate batik patterns, creating a stronger bond between people and their cultural heritage. Our goal is to turn ordinary clothes into a canvas that tells cultural stories, fostering a deep respect for Indonesia's cultural legacy among its wearers.
